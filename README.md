### Description
[Nintendo json](https://www.nintendo.com/json/content/get/filter/game?limit=400)
- game titles
- dates
- amount
- type
- system, etc

We will use this data to create a timeline for users to view information on the nintendo games.


### Explanation
User interaction is necessary to view the information about specific games in the timeline. The games would be on the timeline organized by start date, and when the user hovers over them, information about the game will show up including the  type of game, system, etc.
Filters can be implemented to give the user specific information, such as games only within specific years.
